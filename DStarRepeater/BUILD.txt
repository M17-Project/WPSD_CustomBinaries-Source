Repeater - 20180710
===================

Windows
-------

To use the Repeater control software you will first need to build the latest
version of wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org), the version I used was 3.0.4.
I also installed it in the default location which is C:\wxWidgets-3.0.4.

You will also need a copy of PortAudio (http://www.portaudio.com), I used the
latest stable version and it appears to be fine. I put that into the
"Visual Studio 2017\Projects" folder alongside the source code for the
Repeater itself.

For compiling I use Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition downloaded from Microsoft
for free. I recommend that you use the same.

To build wxWidgets, you simply need to open Visual Studio 2017 using the File ->
Open -> Projects/Solutions and load the wx_vc12.sln file to be found in
wxWidgets-3.0.4\build\msw directory and then go into Batch Build and select the
DLL Debug and DLL Release entries for every one, this take a  little time! Then
build them.

Unfortunately building the software under Windows also requires the downloading 
of a very large file from Microsoft, the WDK. There is no easy way around this
but once installed it can be forgotten about.

The path names for things like wxWidgets and PortAudio are embedded within the
Solution and Project preferences, and will need changing if anything other than
these default locations are used. The first pass through the compiler will no
doubt tell you all that you need to know if there are problems.

Once you have built the executables, you will need to copy the correct portaudio
and wxWidgets files to the same location as the executables. For 32-bit systems
these are portaudio_x86.dll, wxbase30u_vc_custom.dll, wxmsw30u_adv_vc_custom.dll, 
and wxmsw30u_core_vc_custom.dll. On 64-bit systems you'll need portaudio_x64.dll,
wxbase30u_vc_x64_custom.dll, wxmsw30u_adv_vc_x64_custom.dll, and
wxmsw30u_core_vc_x64_custom.dll

If you are running in debug mode then the required wxWidgets files have the names
xxx30ud_xxxx instead. These can be found in the wxWidgets-3.0.4\lib\vc_dll
directory.

It is also probable that you'll need to install a copy of the latest Visual C++
run-time libraries from Microsoft, if you are not running the repeater software
on the same machine as the development/compilation was done on. You can find the
latest versions at https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

Linux
-----

You need to ensure that wxGTK, ALSA and libusb-1.0 are already 
installed on your machine, under Ubuntu these are available from the standard 
repositories, the version of wxWidgets is adequate. However you should get the 
latest version of PortAudio from its home and build it from scratch.

To install them from scratch, you need to get wxGTK from 
<http://www.wxwidgets.org>, and libusb-1.0 from <http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-1.0>.
If you do a "make install" on  all of them then they'll be installed in the
right places and nothing more needs to be done.

On the Raspberry Pi you will need to build and install the wiringPi GPIO library
which is available from <https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi>.
This will allow use the GPIO pins as controller pins for the different repeaters
if needed.

To actually build the software, type "make" in the same directory as this file
and all should build without errors, there may be a warning or two though. Once
compiled log in as root or use the sudo command, and do "make install".
